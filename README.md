# Lane Detection

This project implements a basic lane detection algorithm using computer vision techniques. The current method works well for straight lanes but has difficulty predicting lanes on curves. A future version will address this limitation.

## Features
- 🚗 Detects lanes on roads using image processing.
- 📏 Works well for straight roads.
- 🖥 Uses OpenCV and NumPy for image processing.

## ❌ Limitations
- The current implementation struggles with curved lanes.
- Performance may vary under different lighting and weather conditions.

## 📦 Requirements
Ensure you have the following installed before running the code:
- Python 3.x 🐍
- OpenCV 👀
- NumPy 🔢
- Jupyter Notebook 📓 (if running the `.ipynb` file)

Install dependencies using:
```sh
pip install opencv-python numpy jupyter
```

## 🚀 Running the Project
1. Clone the repository or download the notebook.
2. Open the `LaneDetection.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook.
3. Run the cells step by step to process the input images or video.
4. View the detected lanes on the processed output.

## 🔜 Future Improvements
- ✅ Improved lane detection for curved roads.
- 🧠 Integration with deep learning models for better accuracy.
- 🎥 Real-time lane detection using video input.

Stay tuned for the next version with enhanced capabilities! 🚀
